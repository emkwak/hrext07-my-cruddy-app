Somes ideas for now:

Trader Joes Vegan List:
  -  List all vegan items 
  -  non produce items
  -  place to add new items to the list 
  -  some sort of way to indicate if an item was discontinued 
  -  when selecting certain items it categorize them into a group: beverages, snacks, frozenâ€¦
  -  Or have categorize groups and when selected it shows all those items under that category 

  - Add new products 
    - select category to add items
  - Selecting a category it'll get all items under that category
  - Update existing items
  - Deleting items
    - delete an item ex. if someone added a dairy item
