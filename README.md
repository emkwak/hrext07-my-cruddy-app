Somes ideas for now:

Vegan Alternatives:
  • list of vegan items 
  • list alterative items: alterantives for meat / dairy products when searched 
  • have a suggestion box if the item is unavailable 
  • alternatives for recipes (ex. instead of eggs use ground flax seed)
  •  barcode look up that pings you if the ingredient list contain non-vegan items

Trader Joes Vegan List:
  • List all vegan items 
  • non produce items
  • place to add new items to the list 
  • some sort of way to indicate if an item was discontinued 
  • when selecting certain items it categorize them into a group: beverages, snacks, frozen…
  • Or have categorize groups and when selected it shows all those items under that category 
     
List of vegan restaurants:
  • list vegan / vegetarian option restaurants 
  • search by breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert, snacks, beverages
